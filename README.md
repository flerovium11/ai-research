## About

This is my go at road sign detection with neural networks. I coded a neural network from scratch at first (`neural_network.py`) but then quickly switched to tensorflow because training with my own model was very unstable and programming a network (+ optimizers and everything) from ground up is not the focus of my paper anyway. `classification.ipynb` contains code for training an MLP and CNN on the GTSRB dataset. The models I trained reached ~ 90-98% validation accuracy - there's a link for downloading them further down. I also experimented with creating nice visuals for my paper in the Notebook, displaying what a CNN "sees". The second Notebook `yolo_and_segmentation.ipynb` trains YOLO and a Kind-of-Encoder-Decoder-Model for Segmentation on data that I generated and labeled myself. The raw images and dataset are accessible through the Drive download link. The coolest part is applying YOLO to a live webcam feed (`live_yolo_annotation.py`) and overlaying the models predictions on a video.
